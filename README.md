======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travissimon/huego.png)](https://travis-ci.org/travissimon/huego)

Simple api for Phillips Hue. This is for personal use, so it may not be as full featured as other libraries?
I'm sticking it here for backup, but feel free to use if you find it useful.
